## 🎯 Project Goal & Summary

<img width="1245" height="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f39293-b36b-4753-8cf4-56f134739654" />


This project analyzes road accident data to identify key factors contributing to accident severity, casualties, and year-over-year trends. The findings are presented via an interactive Tableau Dashboard to provide actionable insights for traffic safety planning and intervention strategies.

The analysis is based on accident metrics, including severity, location (using Latitude/Longitude), road conditions, weather, and vehicle type.

## 📊 Key Insights

* **YoY Trends:** Compares key metrics (Accidents, Casualties) between two selected years (e.g., 2022 vs. 2019).
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Pinpoints **high-risk areas** geographically.
* **Environmental Impact:** Analyzes casualties based on **Weather Conditions** and **Road Surface Conditions**.
* **Vehicle Risk Profile:** Shows casualty involvement by **Vehicle Type** (Car, Motorcycle, Van, etc.).

## 🛠️ Technology & Tools

* **Data Visualization:** Tableau Desktop
* **Data Source:** `accident data.csv`
* **Data Storage:** Tableau Hyper (`accident data hyperfile.hyper`)
